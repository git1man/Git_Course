# 2- Explain each method ..

* isupper :The isupper() method returns True if all the characters are in upper case, otherwise False.
Numbers, symbols and spaces are not checked, only alphabet characters.
* islower :The islower() method returns True if all the characters are in lower case, otherwise False.
Numbers, symbols and spaces are not checked, only alphabet characters.
* split :The split() method splits a string into a list.You can specify the separator, default separator is any whitespace.
* join :The join() method takes all items in an iterable and joins them into one string.A string must be specified as the separator.
* strip :() method removes any leading (spaces at the beginning) and trailing (spaces at the end) characters (space is the default leading character to remove)
* isalnum: The isalnum() method returns True if all characters in the string are alphanumeric (either alphabets or numbers). If not, it returns False.
* isalpha :The isalpha() function checks whether a character is an alphabet or not.
In C programming, isalpha() function checks whether a character is an alphabet (a to z and A-Z) or not.
* isdigit :The isdigit() method returns True if all the characters are digits, otherwise False.Exponents, like ², are also considered to be a digit.
* islower : The islower() method returns True if all the characters are in lower case, otherwise False.Numbers, symbols and spaces are not checked, only alphabet characters.
* isupper :The string isupper() method returns whether or not all characters in a string are uppercased or not.
* ljust :The ljust() method will left align the string, using a specified character (space is default) as the fill character.
* center : The center() method will center align the string, using a specified character (space is default) as the fill character.
* rjust :The rjust() method will right align the string, using a specified character (space is default) as the fill character.
* fill :The zfill() method adds zeros (0) at the beginning of the string, until it reaches the specified length.If the value of the len parameter is less than the length of the string, no filling is done.
* format :The format() method formats the specified value(s) and insert them inside the string's placeholder.
* replace :The replace() method replaces a specified phrase with another specified phrase.
* capitalize :The capitalize() function returns a string with the first letter capitalized and all other characters lowercased. It doesn't modify the original string.
* write :To write to an existing file, you must add a parameter to the open() function.
* close :close() closes the opened file. A closed file cannot be read or written any more. Any operation, which requires that the file be opened will raise a ValueError after the file has been closed. Calling close() more than once is allowed.
* format :The format() method formats the specified value(s) and insert them inside the string's placeholder.
